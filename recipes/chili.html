    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Now that it’s officially fall, I think we could all use a good primer on how to make a basic pot of homemade chili. 
        I have several chili recipes on this website, but this basic chili recipe is my absolute favorite. 
        Like, so good that I can’t stop going back for spoonfuls. Not only is this classic chili recipe super flavorful and easy, but it can be used as a template which can be customized in a number of ways to make it your very own.

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>  
    <ul>
        <li>2 Tbsp olive oil.</li>
        <li>1 red onion</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 lb. ground beef or protein of choice</li>
        <li>1 can kidney beans</li>
        <li>1 can black beans </li>
        <li>1 large can diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 small can tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1 tbsp chili powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp cayenne powder</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp onion powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tbsp brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Dice the onion and mince the garlic. Add both to a large pot with the olive oil and cook over medium heat until they are soft and transparent. 
            Add the ground beef and continue to sauté until the beef is fully browned.</li>
        <li>Drain the beans and add them to the pot along with the diced tomatoes, tomato paste, 1 cup water, and all of the ingredients for the chili seasoning. 
            Stir until well combined. Place a lid on the pot and allow it to simmer over a low flame for at least 30 minutes, stirring occasionally (the flavor gets better the longer it simmers). </li>
        <li>Give the chili one final taste, adjust the salt or seasonings if needed, then serve hot with your favorite toppings.</li>
    </ol>
